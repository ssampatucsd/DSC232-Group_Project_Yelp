# DSC232: Yelp Reviews

## Overview
This repository contains the final project for DSC232, featuring a thorough analysis and the creation of predictive models aimed at predicting 'stars' from user review text. Within, you'll find datasets, analytical scripts, model training algorithms, and results designed to offer companies deeper insights into their customers' experiences. Comprehensive documentation is available to help you navigate each aspect of the project.

Below is the writeup for this project. Here is the link to our Jupyter Notebook.

## 1. Introduction
Yelp Inc. is a widely-used online platform where users can search for and review local businesses. Founded in 2004, it acts as a directory for various businesses, including restaurants, retail stores, services, and more. Yelp provides details about the business such as business hours, contact information, menus, photos, and user-generated reviews. Businesses can claim their Yelp profiles to interact with customers, post updates, and respond to reviews.

Yelp has several positive impacts on businesses, such as increasing visibility, establishing credibility and trust, engaging with customers, gaining market insights, and providing advertising opportunities. For instance, Yelp can help businesses get discovered by new customers, driving foot traffic and online inquiries. However, there are also negative impacts, such as the potential for negative reviews to harm a business's reputation and revenue.

This project aims to predict a business's rating out of five stars based on user reviews. We use machine learning techniques to address the challenge of text classification. This predictive goal can provide businesses with insights into what customer experiences are associated with positive and negative reviews. The project is interesting because of its potential positive impact on both businesses and customers. It can enhance the success of businesses and improve customer decision-making, as customers often rely on reviews for their purchasing decisions.

The dataset used in this project is notable for its size and comprehensive information. It is a subset of Yelp's data, containing information about businesses, reviews, and users across eight metropolitan areas in the USA and Canada. The data, sourced directly from Yelp.com, includes 7 million customer reviews and features 150,000 businesses. The credibility, size, and richness of the data were the main reasons for choosing this dataset.
